============================


* focus on setting up an open source repository on github
* start with a blank repo
* scraping the surface of what git can do
* think of it is a toolset for creating your own source control workflow
* I'll quickly recap some basics, and hopefully I'll mention something you haven't seen before.

Presenter Notes:
* keep looking in git gui!
* 2 mins / slide
